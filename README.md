# Census-Income-dataset

The Census Income Dataset, also known as the Adult Income Dataset,is a well-known dataset used in machine learning and data analysis.
It contains information about individuals and their characteristics,including demographic information (e.g., age, education, work class)
and financial information (e.g., income, capital gains, capital losses). The goal of many machine learning models applied to this dataset
is to predict whether an individual's income is above or below $50,000 based on the available features.

The dataset was collected by the US Census Bureau and is freely available for research and educational purposes.
It is commonly used as a benchmark for classification and regression algorithms, as well as for feature selection and feature engineering techniques. 
The size of the dataset varies, but a typical version contains around 32,000 instances and 14 features.
